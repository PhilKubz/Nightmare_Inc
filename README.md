### Story
Upon entering sleep, you are presented with an ominous figure in the shadows.
The figure describes that you have entered Nightmares Inc., a company that provides you with fulfilling nightmares of various sorts.
You must participate, there is no choice.

### Pitch
Horror themed Puzzle/Adventure with multiple styles of mini-games that connect through an overlying story.


### Plan
Initiate development with creation of multiple game modes.
These modes will then be tied together through story elements and the initial scene with the ominous figure that will serve as the antagonist and narrator for the adventure.

While in initial planning stages, continual development of games steadily to produce a game within several months time is possible. Create the MVP then develop detailed assets.
